.h1 Introduction

The name "Wilkin's Brains" comes from a guy I work with at Boeing.  Long
before I arrived, he was a young engineer who carried around schematic
drawings for a system he was working on.  These schematic drawings became
known as "Wilkin's Brains" because they held all the information that he needed
to do his job on a daily basis.

This project is along those same lines for allowing people to manage their
information in a logical and permenant way.

This encarnation of the project is a continuation of a project I used to
call Buckets.

.h1 Use Cases

To describe what this program does, I'll start with some use cases to
explain some of the needs I want this to fill.  

I'll be the first to admit that there are some major overlaps with other
database systems and services already out there and that is no accident.
I am influenced by what I see and read about on the Internet.  Services
like Zoho, some 37signals products, and even low level databases such
as CouchDB have influenced this.  Perhaps one of these systems is better
suited for my needs - we will see.

.h2 Phone Logs

When I'm going to make a business (or even personal) call to someone, I'd
like to keep a record of who, what, where, when, etc.  A call has lots
of context - "what project is being discussed", "who is being called",
"who is being talked about", "what is being talked about", "what the
outcome is", "what actions need to happen as a result of this call", etc.
Below is what I want to do when making a call.

I start by creating a call record (some sort of dropdown or list of
possible records I can create).  This call record is not much more than a
dated and typed record that is used as a container to hold other things.
On my screen I have a newly created blank call record.  I'm going to
call Dan to talk about a business idea, so I find Dan's person record in
the quick search box and drag his person record into the call record.
All of Dan's information is shown in the call record, but it's really
just a reference back to his actual person record.

We're going to discuss a new idea I had and previously I had created an
idea record of my thoughts.  I find this in the quick search box and drag
it into the call record too.

While talking, I create a new note record inside the call record that
is just a free-form text field.  Perhaps we use a Google Wave or EtherPad
type system too.  All of these actions are all being associated with the
original call record that I created.

When done talking, we each may have some things to do.  I can create an
action record that is basically a todo asking for a title and description.
I drag my own user record and Dan's user record into different actions
to denote who needs to work on these things.  These are readily available
on the screen already.

I might drag this call record itself into a container that holds our
conversations, or maybe tag the call record with ThinkSplat.  Whatever
is appropriate for our own organization.
