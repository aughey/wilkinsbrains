== Introduction

The name "Wilkin's Brains" comes from a guy I work with at Boeing.  Long
before I arrived, he was a young engineer who carried around schematic
drawings for a system he was working on.  These schematic drawings became
known as "Wilkin's Brains" because they held all the information that he needed
to do his job on a daily basis.

This project is along those same lines for allowing people to manage their
information in a logical and permenant way.

This encarnation of the project is a continuation of a project I used to
call Buckets.
